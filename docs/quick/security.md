# Unstable ðŸš§ Security Quick Start

> [Authpack](https://authpack.io) ðŸ”’ A complete user and team management system

Authpack providers you with 2 different authentication keys.

- A client key: **safe** to use on the browser.
- A secret key: **not safe** to use in the browser - keep private.

The client key has *restricted* access over on the API and will only work with routes with the `Client` suffix, for example.

- `LoginUserClient`
- `SignupUserClient`
- `GetUserClient`

The secret key has *unrestricted* access over your API and can be used for all API routes, for example.

- `LoginUserClient`
- `CreateUser`
- `ListSessions`

We highly recommend you store both your client and secret keys as an environment variables.
